        <h1>Restorative and Cosmetic Dental Services</h1>
        <p>Restorative and cosmetic dental treatments include all the ways that we can make your smile complete and beautiful. When your teeth become damaged from decay or injury, we can restore them. When they have grown in a way that you’re not happy with or if they no longer have an attractive appearance, we have many tools we can use to give you a smile you enjoy showing off to friends and family. Please take a look at all the kinds of restorative and cosmetic dental services we offer. If you feel you could benefit from any of these services, please contact us and let’s talk about it.</p>

                <h2>Tooth-Colored Fillings</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="restoDiv1P">
                <p>We provide tooth-colored fillings for our patients because they are both durable and attractive. They won’t darken over time like metal fillings will. And because the composite materials used for tooth-colored fillings bond better than metal to your natural teeth, we don’t have to remove as much of your tooth when we clean out the decay. After a minimal amount of decayed tooth is removed, the composite material is placed in the opening and then hardened with a special light. Our patients tell us they prefer the way tooth-colored fillings look. </p>

                <h2>Dental Crowns</h2>
                <p>When a tooth has been damaged by a large filling or impact injury, a dental crown will cover the tooth and prevent further harm. After root canal therapy, a crown is recommended to protect the tooth as it may become brittle over time. A beautiful white porcelain crown will cover the entire tooth above the gum line. We can offer a dental crown for these therapeutic reasons or to improve the appearance of the teeth. </p>

                <h2>Bridges</h2>
                <p>A bridge is a fast and attractive way of replacing a missing tooth. To prepare for a bridge, the teeth adjacent to the gap are prepared by shaping them so they can receive a cap. An impression is then taken of the gap and the two prepared teeth and a bridge is manufactured to fit exactly into this space. When the porcelain bridge is ready, it is cemented over the two prepared teeth. If you have received a bridge, ask us how you should floss under it every day to make it last for many years.</p>

                <h2>Inlays and Onlays</h2>
                <p>Inlays and onlays are manufactured outside the mouth in a dental lab. They are used when a significant amount of decayed tooth material must be removed. Inlays and onlays consist of tooth-colored shapes made of composite resin that will fit exactly into the area that was cleaned out. An inlay is a shape that fits inside the points (cusps) of the teeth and an onlay will cover and replace one or more of these points.</p>

                <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
                <p>Many of our patients are choosing dental implants to replace missing teeth. An implant consists of a titanium post that will replace the root of your tooth, a porcelain crown that replaces the visible part of your tooth and a connector called an abutment. The titanium implant is placed in the jaw and then is allowed to heal and bond with the bone. The abutment is secured to the implant and then the crown is attached to the abutment. You have a new tooth that matches your others and feels just like a natural tooth. We can also use dental implants to secure dentures, eliminating the problem of dentures slipping or coming out. Mini-implants are another choice for some patients who may lack sufficient bone mass for regular implants. If you are interested in dental implants, please contact our office for a consultation. </p>

                <h2>Root Canal Treatment</h2>
                <p>When a tooth has suffered damage from an impact injury or a deep cavity, root canal treatment can still save that tooth. In these cases, the nerve of the tooth has normally been infected or killed by the injury. We will clean out the nerve and sterilize the inside of the tooth. We then pack this open area with sterile material and close the tooth up with a composite filling. We recommend placing a crown on this tooth as soon as possible to enable it to last the rest of your life. </p>

                <h2>Partial and Complete Dentures</h2>
                <p>When multiple teeth have been lost or all upper or lower teeth are missing, we take pride in offering our patients natural-looking and comfortable partial or complete dentures. Dentures can either be conventional or we can anchor them to dental implants for greater comfort and security.</p>

                <h2>Simple and Complex Tooth Extractions</h2>
                <p>When a tooth can be gently eased out of its socket, it is called a simple tooth extraction. When a tooth is embedded in bone or it has complicated roots or is likely to break, it may require a surgical approach and it would be considered a complex extraction. Wisdom teeth are complex extractions in most cases, requiring some degree of surgery to remove them. Dr. Maria Jimenez’s extensive training and more than two decades of experience qualify her to expertly perform both kinds of extractions for her patients.</p>

                <h2>Night Guards</h2>
                <p>A patient who unconsciously grinds their teeth at night can create enormous wear and tear on their teeth. Teeth can be worn down so far that they may need to be restored with crowns. When abnormal wear is detected, we may recommend a night guard to be fitted over the teeth during sleep to prevent any more damage. We are happy to provide our patients with a night guard created especially for them. </p>

                <h2>Teeth Whitening</h2>
                <p>Teeth whitening is a very popular service among our patients. It could be that age has darkened their teeth, or perhaps it was drinking red wine, coffee or tea. Or maybe smoking has left its mark. Our at-home teeth whitening kits are customized for you to give you an effective method of brightening your teeth in a short amount of time. You’ll soon have a more brilliant smile to show off! </p>

                <h2>Dental Bonding</h2>
                <p>This is a fast, effective method of correcting several cosmetic problems. When teeth are so deeply stained that they won’t respond to whitening, dental bonding offers a fast solution. Bonding is also useful when there are minor chips or there is too much space between teeth or teeth are different lengths. Bonding uses composite resin to fill gaps, lengthen a tooth or cover the surface, instantly improving the appearance of your smile.

                <h2>Porcelain Veneers</h2>
                <p>Veneers are very thin sheets of sparkling porcelain that are shaped to fit over the front and tip of your teeth. They can correct poor spacing that results in gaps between the teeth, chips, cracks, irregular or uneven size, length or shape, and deep staining. First, your teeth are minimally prepared for placement of a veneer and the veneers are manufactured to fit into your smile. When the veneers are ready, they are cemented to your teeth and the bond is hardened with a special light. You’re ready to show off your new and improved smile!</p>

                <h2>Orthodontics</h2>
                <p>Dr. Jimenez has extensive training on orthodontics so she can plan the best, fastest and most effective orthodontic treatment program for each patient. We can offer conventional metal braces or clear aligners, depending on a patient’s need and preference. We can also offer young patients early orthodontic care that helps their jaws develop into the right shape for proper tooth alignment. This early system of orthodontia is called Ortho-Tain®. There is also an Ortho-Tain method for adults that results in faster correction of alignment without metal brackets or wires.</p>
