        <h1>Orthodontics Services</h1>
        <p>Dr. Jimenez has extensive training on orthodontics so she can plan the best, fastest and most effective orthodontic treatment program for each patient. We can offer conventional metal braces or clear aligners, depending on a patient’s need and preference. We can also offer young patients early orthodontic care that helps their jaws develop into the right shape for proper tooth alignment. This early system of orthodontia is called Ortho-Tain®. There is also an Ortho-Tain method for adults that results in faster correction of alignment without metal brackets or wires.</p>

                <h2>Metal Braces</h2>
                <p>Metal braces, with metal brackets and wire, are the traditional approach to straightening your teeth. These are typically the most efficient. and sometimes the most effective, orthodontic treatment because the metal is strong and  irremovable. Talk to Dr. Jimenez to see whether metal braces are the right treatment for your teeth during your next appointment.</p>

                <h2>Porcelain Braces</h2>
                <p>Porcelain braces are another great alternative option from metal braces. Rather than the traditional metal wire, porcelain brackets are made with a clear material to allow your teeth to show, making the braces less noticeable. Ask us about our porcelain braces!  </p>

                <h2>ClearCorrect Invisible Braces</h2>
                <p>Invisible braces offer an alternative, hassle-free solution by using clear aligners to straighten teeth invisibly, without metal braces.</p>
                <p>It’s incredibly simple to remove your aligners and eat what you want when you want. Unlike conventional braces, invisible braces (ClearCorrect) does not have wires to trap food or get in the way during flossing routines.</p>

            <h3>How much is ClearCorrect?</h3>
                <p>The average cost of ClearCorrect Limited treatment is approximately $2,500 to $3,500. The average cost of ClearCorrect Full treatment is approximately $4,000 to $5,500. Of course, treatment costs will vary depending on your specific needs. (The cost is similar to the cost of Invisalign.)</p>
            <h3>Steps To Get Invisible Braces (ClearCorrect)</h3>
                <p class="orthoDiv4Txt2">Come in for an evaluation. We are certified in general dentistry able to provide you with orthodontic treatment.</p>
                <p class="orthoDiv4Txt3">Not everyone is a candidate for invisible braces, but we will evaluate your teeth and determine if this is the right treatment for you. If you are the right candidate, then we will take high-resolution digital images and x-rays to model your teeth, and send them off to our labs so your prescription can be made.</p>
                <p class="orthoDiv4Txt4">Once we receive your aligners, it is time to wear them! We will check your progress periodically and give you new sets of aligners as you go. For a minimum of 22 hours a day, these aligners will be worn until we evaluate your progress.</p>
