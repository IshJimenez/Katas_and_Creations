            <h3>What are Opalescence Go whitening trays?</h3>
                <p>The Opalescence Go whitening system is so powerful and effective it is only dispensed by dentists. This whitening treatment has been proven successful at providing dramatic, long-lasting results, and has received many awards in the dental world. </p>
            <h3>How do Opalescence Go whitening trays work? </h3>
                <p>Opalescence Go whitening trays are prefilled, disposable trays that contain a powerful whitening gel. Simply insert the comfortable trays in your mouth and wear for the recommended time, and your teeth will be whiter and brighter!</p>
            <h3>How long do I wear Opalescence Go whitening trays?</h3>
                <p>Wear times for Opalescence Go whitening trays differ depending on whether you use 10% or 15% hydrogen peroxide gel and how dramatic you want your results to be. Trays are generally worn from 15 minutes to one hour per day for anywhere from five to 10 days. </p>
            <h3>How are Opalescence Go whitening trays different from other whitening treatments— over-the-counter and professional?</h3>
                <p>Over-the-counter whitening treatments, such as whitening strips, can lighten teeth. But for optimal results, you want to rely on a professional treatment.</p>
                <p>Opalescence Go whitening trays are different than other professional treatments because they are extremely affordable and effective. With the adaptable, form-fitting UltraFit™ tray, whitening is also extremely comfortable.</p>

            <h3>What causes tooth discoloration?</h3>
                <p>Many factors make teeth lose their luster. Genetics is one factor; some people just have whiter teeth than others. Other factors include cigarettes, dark foods and beverages (including coffee, soda, tea, and red wine), age, medications (such as tetracycline), and tooth trauma. </p>
            <h3>How does teeth whitening work?</h3>
                <p>The active ingredient in most teeth whiteners is some form of peroxide. Oxygen molecules from the peroxide penetrate the tooth and break down discolored molecules.</p>
                <p>Because the oxygen molecules spread throughout the entire tooth, it is not necessary for the whitening gel to touch every part of the tooth for the entire tooth to be whitened.</p>
            <h3>How long do whitening results last?</h3>
                <p>Whitening results typically last several years. If your teeth start to discolor again over time, you can simply repeat a whitening treatment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="teethDiv2-2">
            <h3>Will whitening cause tooth sensitivity?</h3>
                <p>Some people experience sensitivity while whitening, but many do not. Sensitivity does not mean damage has been caused to your teeth. It is temporary and typically disappears within a few days.</p>
                <p>Opalescence whitening gel also contains unique ingredients designed to make your whitening experience as comfortable as possible. Your dentist can provide you with additional desensitizing treatments if you experience lingering discomfort.</p>
            <h3>Will whitening weaken my teeth?</h3>
                <p>No. Whitening has not been shown to weaken teeth.</p>
            <h3>Who can whiten?</h3>
                <p>Almost anyone can successfully whiten their teeth. Opalescence whitening treatments are effective at treating discoloration caused by age, food and drink, cigarettes, medication, or tooth trauma. We also see patients of all ages whiten successfully—from teenagers to 90-year-olds. </p>
