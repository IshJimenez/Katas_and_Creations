                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                <p>We’d like to welcome you to Albania Dental, Dr. Maria Jimenez and her caring staff. Dr. Jimenez has been caring for the dental health of her patients for more than two decades. In this location, we offer a wide variety of dental treatments you and your family may need. Many of our patients never need to be referred out to other specialists because of our investment in training and the latest and best dental technology and equipment.</p>
                <p>We specialize in making our patients feel comfortable and relaxed during their treatment because we have found this makes it easier for them to maintain an ideal schedule of dental care. By working together in this way, we can detect small problems and eliminate them, often preventing bigger problems from ever showing up.</p>
                <p>Please join the Albania Dental family by scheduling yourself or one of your family members for their first or their next visit today. We’re dedicated to helping our New Haven neighbors experience the best in dental care and oral health. We are happy to accept new patients and if you are looking for a second opinion about a recommended treatment program, please feel free to consult with us. </p>
